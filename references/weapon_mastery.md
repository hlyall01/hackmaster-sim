# HackMaster 5e — Weapon Experience and Mastery

## Core Rules
- You can earn weapon experience (wexp) without proficiency, but cannot spend mastery points if unproficient.
- Gaining a mastery point: Earn wexp to reach the weapon group’s threshold (base + modifiers); each threshold grants 1 mastery point.
- Mastery spend: Points can be placed in Attack, Defense, Damage, and Speed. You must take +1 in all aspects before buying +2 Damage, etc.
- Overflow: Extra wexp after gaining a point carries over toward the next threshold.

## Shields and Mastery
- Shields can be mastered with two aspects: Defense and Speed.
- When using a shield, use its Defense mastery instead of your weapon’s (even if worse). Adjust weapon speed by the lower of shield or weapon Speed mastery.

## Thresholds
- Base thresholds: melee 100 wexp; ranged 150 wexp; shields 200 wexp.
- Intelligence adjustment: -2% threshold per point of INT above 10; +2% per point below 10.
- Tier completion: After mastering an entire tier (+1 in all aspects), increase that group’s base threshold by 20% (e.g., bows: 150 → 180 after +1, 180 → 210 after +2).
- Talents may further modify thresholds.

## Wexp Gain per Encounter (per weapon type used)
- One weapon type: 8d6p wexp.
- Two types: 6d6p wexp.
- Three types: 5d6p wexp.
- Four types: 4d6p wexp.
- Five or more types: 3d6p wexp.
- No wexp if encounter lacked a competent opponent.
- If a weapon group is at max tier, it no longer counts as “used” for wexp distribution.

## Free Proficiency
- For each full tier mastered (+1, +2, +3, etc.), gain a free proficiency within the same weapon group (except shields). If already proficient with all weapons in that group, refund the BP of a previously purchased proficiency.
