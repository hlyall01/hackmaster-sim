## Styles

### Weapon and Shield
- **Attack:** Attack normally.
- **Defense:** d20p + shield bonus + modifiers. If attack roll is below but within 10 of your defense roll, it hits the shield for shield damage (usually half damage dice), which may cause breakage. Shield DR then reduces that damage before any remainder is applied.

### Two-Handed Weapon
- **Attack:** Attack normally.
- **Defense:** d20p + modifiers against one enemy attack between your own attacks; second and later defenses in that window use d20p - 4 + modifiers.

### One-Handed Weapon (one-handed)
- **Attack:** -1 speed bonus for focusing on a single weapon.
- **Defense:** d20p - 4 + modifiers.

### One-Handed Weapon (two-handed grip)
- **Attack:** +3 damage; +2 to speed.
- **Defense:** d20p + modifiers against one enemy attack between your own attacks; second and later defenses in that window use d20p - 4 + modifiers.

### Two One-Handed Weapons (offensive)
- **Attack:** Primary initial attack normal. Subsequent primary attacks at primary speed + 2. Secondary initial attack occurs 2 seconds after primary plus half primary speed; subsequent secondary attacks at secondary speed + 2. Secondary weapon takes -2 damage.
- **Defense:** d10p + primary weapon defense bonus + other modifiers. Near-perfect defense damage is full if the secondary weapon is smaller than the wielder.

### Two One-Handed Weapons (defensive)
- **Attack:** Attack normally with primary weapon.
- **Defense:** d20p + both weapon defense bonuses + modifiers against one enemy attack between primary weapon attacks; second and later defenses in that window use d20p - 4 + same modifiers. Near-perfect defense damage is full if the secondary weapon is smaller than the wielder.

### Shield Only
- **Attack:** Unarmed or shield bash only.
- **Defense:** +1 to defense; opponents attack at half their weapon speed; otherwise as weapon and shield.

### Two Shields
- **Attack:** Shield bash only.
- **Defense:** As weapon and shield, but both shield bonuses apply against frontal and flank attackers; opponents attack at half their weapon speed.
