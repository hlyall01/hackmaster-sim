## Tactical Movement per Encumbrance (feet per second)

| Encumbrance | Crawl¹ | Walk | Jog | Run | Sprint |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| None | 2.5 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
| Light | 2.5 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
| Medium | 2.5 | 5 | 10 | 12.5² | 15 |
| Heavy | 2.5 | 5 | 7.5² | 10 | - |

¹ Move 5 ft every other second.  
² Move slower on the first second, faster on the next, alternating each second.

From standing, a character can walk or jog immediately, but not run or sprint. Walking/jogging can transition to run/sprint on subsequent seconds. Characters may only sprint for half their Con in seconds (rounded down). Recovery to sprint again takes (16 + d4p − Con) minutes; a result of 0 or less allows sprinting again after 10 seconds.
