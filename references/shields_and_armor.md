# Shields and Armor (Player's Handbook excerpt)

When defending against a typical attack, an unshielded defender rolls a d20p-4 and adds his Defense Bonus (any Wisdom, Dexterity or additional defense modifiers), comparing the result against the attacker’s d20p plus Attack Bonus. Using a shield, however, eliminates the “-4” penalty and improves the defender’s roll to d20p plus Defense Bonus (as noted above and including the shield’s own defense bonus).

On a failed defense roll when using a shield, the attacker successfully bypasses the shield and rolls the appropriate damage directly against the defender. Any damage in excess of the armor’s Damage Reduction value is taken as a loss of Hit Points (i.e., a wound).

For example, let’s postulate that Brynhildr the fighter (who wears leather armor and carries a small shield) has just been attacked by an orc. If her total defense (d20p roll plus Defense Bonus) is less than her opponent’s total attack (d20p roll plus Attack Bonus), she fails to successfully defend herself, and the GM rolls the orc’s damage dice. From this total Brynhildr’s player subtracts 2 points (to account for the damage reduction of Brynhildr’s leather armor) and records the balance as a wound.

If a defender with a shield succeeds in his defense roll, and the attack did not miss completely as indicated by a modified score of 10+ worse than the defense total (see also a result of “1” by the attacker or “20” by the defender, these special numbers are explained later), the attacker rolls shield damage instead of normal damage and the defender applies it to his shield.

Versus ranged attacks shields also provide cover and prevent the defense roll from being a d12 isntead of a d20 when not moving, and they provide cover as shown in this table

Shield
Type Cost Defense
Bonus
Damage
Reduction Cover Value Weight
(pounds)
Buckler 9 sp +2 4 HP 20 4
Small 15 sp +4 4 HP 19 7
Medium 30 sp +6 6 HP 16 14
Large 60 sp +6 6 HP 11 24
Body 90 sp +6 6 HP 6 35

the cover value is a maximum attack roll that the attacker can roll with a ranged weapon against the defender

Shields, while resilient, may be splintered and destroyed by a heavy blow. The likelihood of this occurring is a direct function of the damage dealt by the blow. If the shield user succeeds in his defense roll, and the attack did not miss completely as indicated by a modified score of 10 or more lower than the defense total, the attacker rolls his shield damage value for his weapon (typically half the dice, but full damage modifier) and the defender applies it to his shield (see tables below). Damage in excess of the shield's Damage Reduction value is blunt trauma absorbed by the character's armor and natural damage reduction (if any). Any remaining damage is suffered as a loss of Hit Points (i.e., a wound). Magical shields cannot be broken through normal means.
