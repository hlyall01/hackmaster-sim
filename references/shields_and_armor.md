# Shields and Armor (Player's Handbook excerpt)

When defending against a typical attack, an unshielded defender rolls a d20p-4 and adds his Defense Bonus (any Wisdom, Dexterity or additional defense modifiers), comparing the result against the attacker’s d20p plus Attack Bonus. Using a shield, however, eliminates the “-4” penalty and improves the defender’s roll to d20p plus Defense Bonus (as noted above and including the shield’s own defense bonus).

On a failed defense roll when using a shield, the attacker successfully bypasses the shield and rolls the appropriate damage directly against the defender. Any damage in excess of the armor’s Damage Reduction value is taken as a loss of Hit Points (i.e., a wound).

For example, let’s postulate that Brynhildr the fighter (who wears leather armor and carries a small shield) has just been attacked by an orc. If her total defense (d20p roll plus Defense Bonus) is less than her opponent’s total attack (d20p roll plus Attack Bonus), she fails to successfully defend herself, and the GM rolls the orc’s damage dice. From this total Brynhildr’s player subtracts 2 points (to account for the damage reduction of Brynhildr’s leather armor) and records the balance as a wound.

If a defender with a shield succeeds in his defense roll, and the attack did not miss completely as indicated by a modified score of 10+ worse than the defense total (see also a result of “1” by the attacker or “20” by the defender, these special numbers are explained later), the attacker rolls half damage dice and adds the full damage modifiers if any (e.g., 2d6+1 becomes d6+1) and the defender applies it to his shield.
