# Special Combat Moves (HackMaster 5e)

### Jab
- Prereq: Weapon with a jab speed.
- Effect: Attack at jab speed; damage is half and does not penetrate.

### Hold at Bay
- Trigger: Single target enters your Reach and your Reach is longer.
- Resolution: Make normal attack; no damage on hit unless the weapon can Jab (then a Jab is allowed).
- Result: Target cannot attack or advance while held. They must knock aside your weapon with a d20p Attack vs your shieldless Defense to close; on success they may make their engagement attack on the next second.

### Aggressive Attack
- Modifiers: +5 to next Attack, -2 to next Defense.
- Interaction: Deals half damage if defender uses Give Ground or Scamper Back.
- Restrictions: Cannot stack with other maneuvers; no maneuvers until your next attack.

### Charge
- Requirements: Run/sprint at least 20 feet in a straight line to contact.
- Modifiers: +4 Attack; lose Dex bonus to Defense for 5 seconds after contact.
- Damage: Normal damage, but treated as doubled for knockback calculations.

### Ready Against Charge
- Requirements: Polearm or spear that can be Set for Charge; brace for 3 seconds before contact.
- Resolution: Defender attacks first; a hit breaks the charge (attacker loses charge benefits) and deals double weapon damage (e.g., spear 4d6p instead of 2d6p); attacker is held at bay.

### Tactical Move
- Effect: Move at walking pace while engaged.
- Modifiers: -1 Attack and -1 Defense until your next attack; penalties stack with repeated tactical moves.

### Fight Defensively
- Declaration: Announce before your attack.
- Modifiers: Choose Attack penalty -2/-4/-6/-8 for corresponding Defense bonus +1/+2/+3/+4.
- Limitations: Your successful attacks cannot penetrate while this is active (even on near-perfect/perfect). Next attack still suffers the chosen penalty even if you drop the stance. Can combine with Give Ground or Scamper Back.

### Full Parry
- Effect: Skip your attack to focus on defense; gain +5 to Defense until your next attack.
- Can combine with: Give Ground, Scamper Back, Fighting Withdrawal.

### Give Ground
- Trigger: When attacked.
- Effect: Retreat at walking speed; gain +5 Defense vs that attack; suffer -1 to your next Attack.
- Notes: Attacker may automatically advance. Cannot use if no space, versus faster walkers, or vs a charge.

### Scamper Back
- Trigger: When attacked.
- Effect: Retreat at jogging pace; gain +5 Defense vs that attack; suffer -4 to your next Attack.
- Notes: Attacker may automatically advance. Cannot use if no space, versus faster walkers, or vs a charge.

### Fighting Withdrawal
- Effect: Move at walking speed to back up or sidestep during melee.
- Modifiers: -2 to your next Attack and while you continue withdrawing. Opponents may pursue unless blocked by allies.

### Flee
- Action: Turn and jog away from melee at any time.
- Risk: Opponent may make an attack if they are due one in the next half weapon speed seconds; if they take it, their pursuit is delayed by half their weapon speed (rounded up). A threatening ally negates this attack.
- Movement: Opponent can follow at normal speed unless blocked.
- Limits: Cannot use shield for Defense while fleeing; use d10p for Defense roll. If you flee then re-engage, your attack speed is reset.
